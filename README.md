# Machine Learning
## [Bayes_Classifier](https://github.com/fardinabbasi/Bayes_Classifier)
Conducting **one-vs-all** classification on the 'penguins.csv' dataset using both the **Naive Bayes classifier** implemented **from scratch** and the one provided by **Scikit-Learn's built-in** functions.
## [Decision_Tree](https://github.com/fardinabbasi/Decision_Tree)
Performing a Decision Tree classifier on the 'Diabetes.csv' dataset to distinguish between diabetes and non-diabetes cases.
## [Expectation_Maximization](https://github.com/fardinabbasi/Expectation_Maximization)
Implementation of **EM algorithm**, and performing **GMM estimation** on an image dataset containing images of Manchester United and Chelsea football clubs to classify them.
## [Linear_Regression](https://github.com/fardinabbasi/Linear_Regression)
Performing regression of several degrees on generated data points affected by white and Poisson noise. Additionally, studying its **MSE loss** and **bias-variance trade-off**.
## [Logistic_Regression](https://github.com/fardinabbasi/Logistic_Regression)
Implementing logistic regression with **L2** Regularization **from scratch** to classify two circular datasets.
## [Neural_Networks](https://github.com/fardinabbasi/Neural_Networks)
### [Multi Layer Perceptron](https://github.com/fardinabbasi/Neural_Networks/tree/MLP)
Performing an MLP model on the ECG signals dataset.
### [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/fardinabbasi/Neural_Networks/tree/CNN)
Performing a CNN model on the CIFAR-10 image dataset.
## [PCA](https://github.com/fardinabbasi/PCA)
Performing PCA on the "emotion_detection" dataset contains 213 images with 6 labels: Happy, Fear, Angry, Disgust, Surprise, and Sad.
## [ParzenWindow](https://github.com/fardinabbasi/ParzenWindow)
Performing **non-parametric Parzen Window estimation** on the 'ted_main.csv' dataset, both **from scratch** and using **built-in** functions.
## [SVM](https://github.com/fardinabbasi/SVM)
Performing Support Vector Classification (SVC) on the iris dataset.
